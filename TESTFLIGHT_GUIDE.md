2. Archive and upload to App Store Connect

## Troubleshooting

### Code Signing Issues:
- Make sure you're signed in to Xcode with your Apple ID
- Verify your Apple Developer account is active
- Check that Bundle ID is unique and registered

### Build Failures:
- Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
- Ensure Xcode is up to date
- Check that iOS deployment target is set to 16.0+

### TestFlight Issues:
- External testing requires Beta App Review (24-48 hours)
- Internal testing (up to 100 users) is immediate if they're on your dev team
- Builds expire after 90 days
